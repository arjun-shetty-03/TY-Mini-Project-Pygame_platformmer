# TY-Mini-Project-Pygame_platformmer
The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in implementing various gaming mechanisms and features within Python, focusing on our own original single python video game.
Our game is called “Super Pirate World” akin to the popular Nintendo game Super Mario. This is our own take at replicating a 2-D platformer from the past similar to Super Mario.
In our last  presentation we had put forth the idea that we’d make 3 separate video games but one of  the panel members , had suggested the idea of just making 
one game instead since it would be a huge task and that’s what we did. 
With the help of this project we aim to understand how large projects with multiple moving pieces come together and make a cohesive program together.
